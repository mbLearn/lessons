## Github Commands to start 

1. First you have to clone the repository to you local machine

git clone github_url local_directory

2. Then you can create local folders and files inside your local_directory, 
and add them to the repo using

git add file_path

3. You can also add everything using.

git add .

4. Note that git does not track empty folder. A work-around is to create a file inside the empty folder 
you want to track. I usually name that file empty but it can be whatever name you choose.

5. Finally, you commit and push back to github

git commit
git push

-A Update the index not only where the working tree has a file matching but also
